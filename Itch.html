        <p>My attempt at VR! This game tries to fully utilize virtual reality, not only using the controllers but your body. In this group project i am the lead-programmer and focused a lot of time on the VR aspect of the game.</p>

            <h1>Eight Rooms</h1>
        </a>

        <p>My attempt at a scary game with a bit of story. in this game you play as someone controlling "robots" who's goal is to defeat a captured monster, as you try to defeat the monster it will try to escape. good luck!</p>

        <p>My first attemp at a Online multiplayer game, as the flame your goal is to utilize Zeek's vulnerable house to burn it all down! However playing as Zeek you will run around blocking the fire from spreading with doors and make sure none of your house starts burning</p>

            <h1>Primordials</h1>
        </a>

        <p>This is a passion project of mine, this is the game i am intending to work on for the years to come. it is still in really early development, however it is the most technically impressive game i have ever made.</p>

        <p>A simple platfomer game, with interesting game mechanics. This was a collaberative game where i was the lead-programmer.</p>

            <h1>Light Bulb Pain</h1>
        </a>

        <p>A game designed to be as painful to play as possible, however rewarding if you actually do it. in this game you are given a bunch of lightbulbs, pick one test if it works, if it doesn't try again with a different light bulb.</p>

        <p>My first game ever, this game was made mostely to improve my skill as a programmer. however this game is a puzzle game with a hint of story.</p>
